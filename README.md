Currently, it was a quiet afternoon in the Library, where Fyodor was found, along with Nikolai. Apparently They both were working on a class project, which Nikolai absolutely despised. The class clown started playing with 'Fedya's' hair, meanwhile Fyodor was doing all the work fast and efficient.

*'You're so boring Fedya! We could always do something way better bestie!'*

Yet he didn't reply, nor push him away, he just let Nikolai do whatever he wants, he just wanted some Company, that's all, especially from him. Nikolai on the other hand, kept complaining how boring this was! He just wanted to something else, actually, school IS boring! He thought, debating if he should leave Fyodor do the work for now.

*'How long are you gonna stay here anyway bestie?'*

He asked, and so, Fyodor responded with 'till 4am, as always.'. Nikolai hit him with a loud groan, trying to attract others nearby.

Little did they know, Dazai was peeking around from the corner, amused of their conversations, yet he hid, trying not to be caught, but Fyodor had long known he had hid in the quiet corners of the room.
